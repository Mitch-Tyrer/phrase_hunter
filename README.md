Using Classes to create a game state and phrase state that are updated based on user interaction

the Phrase class will generate a random phrase that is then split into into letters and placed on the game board

the game class will log what letters the user has guessed and disable them accordingly so they cannot be guessed again. and if they are in the phrase update the state so show it.

if the phrase is guessed correctly they win.  IF they run out of lives/guesses they lose the game and can retry with a different phrase
